**Overview**

This project builds an interactive Blinkit Analytics Dashboard using Power BI Desktop to analyse delivery service data (orders, products, regions, etc.).
The aim is to help business teams and stakeholders visualise delivery performance, product demand, customer behaviour, and operational insights.


**Tools & Technologies**

Power BI Desktop – dashboard authoring

Power Query Editor – data cleaning and transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated measures and KPIs

CSV / Excel dataset (or operational database extract) – for driving the dashboard


**Insights Derived**

1. Identify which products/categories contribute most to cancellations or returns

2. Discover regions with delivery delays and plan optimisation

3. Detect peak order times and map resource allocation accordingly

4.Examine correlations between order volume, category, and delivery success

2. Open the Blinkit_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.

3. If needed, update the dataset connection path to dataset/Blinkit_Data.csv.

4. Refresh the data to load and apply transformations.

5. Navigate the dashboard – use filters/slicers for region, product, time-period to explore insights.
